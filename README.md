# AoC-2022
advent of code 2022

My second year doing Advent of Code.  This year seems smoother but still I had to poke around on the internet when I was just not getting anywhere.
Here are my 2 biggest usage of the internet resources.
1.  Sometimes, I just needed a walkthrough to confirm what exactly the question is looking for.
2.  There are times when my solution works only for the test case and not on the main puzzle.  In these situations, I use published solutions to generate
some additional test cases for my code to debug.
3.  Then there are the ones that I had no idea how to solve and got inspiration from the internet on what the general approach is but I never copied code.
4.  I did this all on replit and yes it took me 10+ hours of coding on the upper level puzzles.
